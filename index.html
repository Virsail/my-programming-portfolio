                <p>The reason I decided to take programming class is because i've always dreamt of being an engineer since i was young
                    but I didn't know that there are various types of engineering so when i got to high school I came to realize that 
                    there are so many types of engineering ,at form one level I took computer studies as a technical subject and at 
                    Booker academy high school we were so equipped with state of the art computer laboratories and this made me enjoy 
                    the environment.I became very good at computer studies and ended up being a champion in the subject receiving gifts
                    every now and then ,I got to form 4 and did elementary programming ,algorithms and writing pseudo codes and coming 
                    up with flowcharts .I really loved it though it was hectic at once but I enjoyed it and that love for computer 
                    studies and the fact that I enjoyed elementary programming led me to this awesome world of software development.
